# CS-350

This project aimed to develop a smart thermostat solution that efficiently controls room temperature, interfacing with IoT devices and the cloud to enable remote monitoring and control. It addresses the need for energy-efficient climate control and user comfort.

The project particularly excelled in outlining the hardware support for different architectures and explaining how a thermostat connects to the cloud via Wi-Fi. Additionally, it provided insights into Flash and RAM resources, supporting code execution.

Areas for improvement include offering a more in-depth discussion of code implementation and providing specific examples for each hardware architecture. Additionally, including real-world case studies or practical applications could enhance the report.

To enhance my support network, I am considering participating more often in online forums or communities focused on IoT and embedded systems development, as well as exploring further resources provided by hardware manufacturers and cloud service providers.

The skills gained in developing IoT solutions, hardware integration, and understanding cloud connectivity will be highly transferable to other IoT projects and coursework in embedded systems, cloud computing, and network communication.

To make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable, thorough code comments and a structured outline were employed. Modularity in code design and adherence to best practices for naming conventions and coding standards ensured maintainability and readability. Additionally, the use of version control systems allowed for easy adaptation and future improvements to the project.
